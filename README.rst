About the Aristotle Metadata Registry
-------------------------------------

Aristotle-MDR is an open-source metadata registry as described in the ISO/IEC 11179:2013 specification.

Aristotle-MDR represents a new way to manage and federate content built on and extending the principles of leading metadata registries. The code of Aristotle is completely open-source, building on the Django web framework and the mature model of the 11179 standard, allowing agencies to easily run their own metadata registries while also having the ability to extend the information model and tap into the permissions and roles of ISO 11179.

By allowing organisations to run their own independent registries they are able to expose authoritative metadata along with the governance processes behind its creation, and by building upon known and open systems agencies, can deliver a stable platform for the sharing of metadata.
